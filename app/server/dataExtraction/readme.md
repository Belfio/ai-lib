### Notes on architecture

Below is a deeper dive into resilience for your system—especially for scenarios in which Textract (or any asynchronous extraction service) can take a while to finish. In summary, these are the main concerns: 1. Handling Long-Running Textract Jobs 2. Scaling Limits for Lambda 3. Failure and Retry Strategies 4. Recommended Patterns for End-to-End Reliability

1. Handling Long-Running Textract Jobs

1.1. Asynchronous Nature of Textract
• StartDocumentTextDetection (or StartDocumentAnalysis) in Textract kicks off a job that runs asynchronously.
• You then periodically poll (via GetDocumentTextDetection) or set up an SNS/SQS notification to know when it completes.

1.2. Limitations of Synchronous Polling in a Single Lambda
• If you try to poll inside a single Lambda, you risk hitting the Lambda time limit (15 minutes max).
• For large PDFs (or when AWS is under heavy load), Textract may not finish within a short timeframe.

1.3. Recommended Pattern: Event-Driven Asynchronous Workflow 1. Start the Textract job in one Lambda (or your application logic). 2. Immediately exit that Lambda after you receive the JobId. 3. Textract sends a completion notification to an SNS topic. 4. SNS is subscribed to SQS (or directly subscribed to another Lambda). 5. When the Textract job completes, Textract -> SNS -> SQS triggers a second Lambda. 6. That second Lambda calls GetDocumentTextDetection (or GetDocumentAnalysis) to retrieve the final results.

Why is this more resilient?
• You’re not blocking a single Lambda function for a long time.
• If Textract is slow or large, it can still finish in the background.
• Once Textract finishes, your second Lambda picks up the job asynchronously.

1.4. Using AWS Step Functions

Instead of manually wiring SNS/SQS, you can use AWS Step Functions to orchestrate: 1. A Task State to start the Textract job. 2. A Wait State that either waits a fixed time or uses an AWS callback pattern. 3. Another Task State to retrieve results.

This offloads complex state management (polling, retry, error handling) to Step Functions, making your workflow more maintainable and robust.

2. Scaling Limits for Lambda

2.1. Concurrency
• AWS Lambda has a concurrency limit (the default is often 1,000 per account per region, but can be higher or lower depending on your account).
• If you get a sudden spike of PDFs, you can run out of concurrency. Then new Lambda invocations will be throttled.
• You can request a higher concurrency limit from AWS if needed.

2.2. Memory and CPU
• Lambda’s CPU scales with the memory setting. If Textract job orchestration or data post-processing requires more CPU, you may need to bump the memory. But remember that cost scales with memory, too.

2.3. Execution Timeout
• A single Lambda invocation cannot exceed 15 minutes.
• If polling for Textract completion is done inside one Lambda, it might time out if the job is slow.
• Hence, the recommended approach is an asynchronous callback (SNS -> second Lambda or Step Functions).

3. Failure and Retry Strategies

3.1. Lambda Retries
• By default, when Lambda is invoked by an S3 event (synchronously), there is no built-in retry for your function. The event is considered “processed” after the Lambda returns. If your code throws an error, you’ll see it in logs, but the same S3 event does not automatically re-invoke.
• If you want built-in retries for ingestion, a pattern is:
• S3 -> SNS -> SQS -> Lambda
• With SQS as the event source, Lambda will automatically retry (up to a certain number of times) if it fails.

3.2. Dead-Letter Queues (DLQ)
• For critical operations, configure a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).
• If all retries fail, the message (the job request) goes to a DLQ.
• You can monitor the DLQ for stuck/failing jobs.

3.3. Step Functions Error Handling
• If you use Step Functions, each state can have a built-in Retry and Catch.
• You can specify exponential backoff, maximum attempts, fallback states, and so on.
• This is typically more robust than “roll-your-own” retry logic inside a single Lambda.

3.4. Circuit Breaker Patterns
• If you integrate with external AI APIs (e.g., Google Document AI, Nanonets, etc.), you might hit rate limits or see occasional slowdowns.
• A “circuit breaker” approach (e.g., using library patterns or Step Functions fallback) can help direct traffic to a fallback service if one is consistently failing or responding slowly.

4. Recommended Patterns for End-to-End Reliability

4.1. S3 -> Lambda for Simple Use Cases 1. User uploads PDF to S3. 2. S3 event triggers Lambda. 3. Lambda starts the Textract job asynchronously and writes a “Job Started” state somewhere (DynamoDB or Step Functions). 4. Lambda exits quickly.

Separately: 5. Textract posts a notification to SNS on job completion. 6. SNS triggers a second Lambda which fetches the results and stores them in DynamoDB (state = “Job Succeeded”) or signals the front-end.

4.2. AWS Step Functions Workflow 1. Step Functions receives an event to process a PDF (maybe from an API request). 2. Task State: Call Textract StartDocumentTextDetection. 3. Wait or Callback: If you use an SNS topic for Textract completion, you can employ the Task Token (callback pattern), or simply Wait + poll in subsequent states. 4. Task State: Retrieve results with GetDocumentTextDetection. 5. Success: Store data in DynamoDB, mark workflow as complete.

Benefits
• Automatic retries, error handling, and timeouts per state.
• Visual workflow in the AWS Step Functions console.

4.3. Observability
• CloudWatch Logs: Each Lambda automatically writes logs.
• Custom CloudWatch Alarms: E.g., if “TextractFailedJobsCount” > 0 in a 5-minute window, send an alert.
• Dashboards: Combine metrics (Lambda concurrency, Textract job count, error count) on a single CloudWatch dashboard.

4.4. Handling Partial Failures or Partial Pages
• If you have extremely large PDFs, Textract can chunk the document into multiple parts. You may have to aggregate results. Step Functions or a queue-based approach helps manage partial successes (some pages extracted, some failed).

Putting It All Together 1. Maximize Asynchrony: Let Textract run in the background; do not hold a Lambda open waiting. 2. Use Reliable Event Flows: S3 -> SNS -> SQS -> Lambda or Step Functions for robust, observable workflows. 3. Retry & DLQ: Configure automatic retry + DLQ so you can recover from transient failures. 4. Monitor & Log: Use CloudWatch alarms and dashboards to detect issues early. 5. Scale: If you receive a high volume of PDFs, ensure you have enough Lambda concurrency and manage Textract job throughput (Textract has its own concurrency quotas). 6. Graceful Error Handling: If a job or Lambda fails, log it, push to DLQ or track in Step Functions to reprocess or manually intervene.

In Short
• If Textract takes a long time: Avoid synchronous polling in a single Lambda. Instead, adopt an asynchronous or Step Functions approach.
• How much can Lambda sustain: By default, up to 1,000 concurrent executions, each up to 15 minutes max. You can increase concurrency limits with AWS Support.
• If the Lambda fails:
• Without additional configuration, the S3 event is considered processed, and you only see the error in logs.
• With a queue-based approach, Lambda automatically retries, and if it fails repeatedly, the message goes to a DLQ.
• With Step Functions, you can automatically retry or catch errors in the workflow.

Using these patterns and best practices, you can build a robust, fault-tolerant PDF extraction pipeline that can handle large documents, surges in workload, and occasional external service hiccups.
